a device might be implemented from one of its access points

those are super or sub modules or via some port -> domain -> access point device


a device implemention builder might consume an access point
to create the implementation

for example

mcp from i2cslave sub module
i2cmaster from avr super device
avr from serialmodule submodule
serialmodule from serialmodule via domain
serialmodule from host as submodule

i2cslave from i2cmaster via domain
host from host via domain



builder.usesSuperModule
builder.usesSubmodule
builder.users Port
builder.produces InterfaceType


builder registered and has blackbird

build device interfacetype

    -> get my stuff and implement


port consumer

topologie

a device has subdevices/modules
a device might have a superdevice
a device has ports
a port generally belongs to a domain
